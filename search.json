    "text": "Figure 1: Forage Quality metrics by treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 ADF model summary\nADF content was slightly but significantly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had no measurable effect (Table 1). A significant positive interaction indicated that pika partially offset the reduction in ADF caused by the poison plant. Contrasts showed that poison plant treatment generally lowered ADF, but this effect was weaker in pika-present plots (Table 2). Random variation across blocks and months was small, with no detectable year-to-year variation (Table 1).\n\n\n2 CP model summary\nCrude protein (CP) content was significantly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had a marginally non-significant positive effect (Table 3). A strong positive interaction showed that pika presence substantially mitigated the reduction in CP caused by the poison plant. Contrasts confirmed lower CP in treated plots without pika, but this reduction was much smaller in pika-present plots (Table 4). Random variation across blocks and months was minimal, with no variation across years.\n\n\n3 NDF model summary\nNeutral detergent fiber (NDF) content was slightly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had no significant effect (Table 5). The interaction between pika and the poison plant was not significant, indicating that pika did not modify the treatment’s effect on NDF.

However, the strong positive interaction term (+0.132 kg/day) indicates that pika presence largely neutralizes the negative effect of S. chamaejasme, resulting in weight gain similar to control conditions. Contrasts show that while S. chamaejasme sharply reduces weight gain in the absence of pikas, this reduction disappears when pikas are present, suggesting a facilitative role of pikas in mitigating plant-induced losses (Table 13)."

The interaction between pika and poison plant treatments was not significant, indicating that pika did not alter the poison plant’s effect on forb cover. Random variation across blocks and years was small, and no month-to-month variation was detected.\n\n\n2 Grasses Cover\nGrass cover was significantly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, with odds of occurrence dropping to less than half in treated plots. Pika presence alone had no detectable effect in untreated plots, but in treated plots, pika presence substantially increased grass cover, offsetting some of the negative effect of the poison plant. This positive interaction suggests that pika may facilitate grass recovery when S. chamaejasme is present. Random variation across blocks and months was small, and no variation was detected across years. See the model summary and contrast tables (Table 3, Table 4).\n\n\n3 S. chamaejasme Cover\nStellera chamaejasme cover was strongly increased in the poison plant treatment (Table 5). Pika presence alone had no significant effect in untreated plots but significantly reduced the large cover gains from the poison plant treatment (Table 6). This interaction indicates that pika substantially suppress S. chamaejasme when it is present in high abundance. Random variation across blocks, years, and months was small relative to the fixed effects.\n\n\n4 Sedges Cover\nSedge cover was significantly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had no significant effect. The positive pika × poison plant interaction was marginally non-significant (p = 0.076), suggesting a possible tendency for pika to lessen the negative effect of the poison plant (Table 7). Random variation was small across blocks and months, and no year-to-year variation was detected.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Model summary for forb cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\n(Intercept)\n-1.123\n0.106\n-10.556\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\npika\n0.048\n0.096\n0.497\n0.619\n\n\nfixed\npoison plant\n-0.219\n0.099\n-2.210\n0.027\n\n\nfixed\npika : poison treamtent\n0.090\n0.139\n0.650\n0.515\n\n\nran_pars\nblock\n0.104\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nyear\n0.089\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nmonth\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Estimated marginal means contrasts for forb cover by treatment group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Model summary for grass cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\n(Intercept)\n-1.109\n0.096\n-11.579\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\npika\n-0.088\n0.099\n-0.895\n0.371\n\n\nfixed\npoison plant\n-0.878\n0.113\n-7.758\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\npika : poison treamtent\n0.898\n0.151\n5.966\n0.000\n\n\nran_pars\nblock\n0.130\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nyear\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nmonth\n0.020\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Estimated marginal means contrasts for grass cover by treatment group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrast\nodds.ratio\nSE\ndf\nnull\nz.ratio\np.value\n\n\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika No S. chamaejasme\n1.092\n0.108\nInf\n1\n0.895\n0.807\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n2.407\n0.272\nInf\n1\n7.758\n0.000\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n1.071\n0.105\nInf\n1\n0.692\n0.900\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n2.203\n0.252\nInf\n1\n6.917\n0.000\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.980\n0.097\nInf\n1\n-0.204\n0.997\n\n\nno pika S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.445\n0.051\nInf\n1\n-7.105\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Model summary for S. chamaejasme cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\n(Intercept)\n-3.438\n0.257\n-13.390\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\npika\n-0.105\n0.215\n-0.489\n0.625\n\n\nfixed\npoison plant\n2.252\n0.174\n12.914\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\npika : poison treamtent\n-1.153\n0.252\n-4.576\n0.000\n\n\nran_pars\nblock\n0.159\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nyear\n0.170\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nmonth\n0.243\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Estimated marginal means contrasts for S. chamaejasme cover by treatment group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrast\nodds.ratio\nSE\ndf\nnull\nz.ratio\np.value\n\n\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika No S. chamaejasme\n1.111\n0.239\nInf\n1\n0.489\n0.962\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n0.105\n0.018\nInf\n1\n-12.914\n0.000\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.370\n0.070\nInf\n1\n-5.286\n0.000\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n0.095\n0.017\nInf\n1\n-13.289\n0.000\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.333\n0.063\nInf\n1\n-5.769\n0.000\n\n\nno pika S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n3.519\n0.463\nInf\n1\n9.558\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Model summary for sedge cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\n(Intercept)\n0.024\n0.076\n0.319\n0.750\n\n\nfixed\npika\n0.115\n0.077\n1.499\n0.134\n\n\nfixed\npoison plant\n-0.269\n0.077\n-3.506\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\npika : poison treamtent\n0.193\n0.109\n1.775\n0.076\n\n\nran_pars\nblock\n0.083\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nyear\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\nmonth\n0.060\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Estimated marginal means contrasts for sedge cover by treatment group."

    "text": "Figure 1: The hypothesized facilitative effects of pika on yak in the Tibetan Plateau. In the absence of pika, the poisonous Stellera chamaejasme forbs should exert a strong negative effect on yak growth performance by competing with the palatable grasses and sedges, decreasing their food availability and foraging efficiency (Fig. 1a). However, such negative effects of poisonous plants should be mitigated in the presence of pika, whom eliminate S. chamaejasme forbs by their feeding and clipping activities, leading to a facilitative effect on yak (Fig. 1b). The negative effects of poisonous plants on yak were indicated as black dashed lines, the competition between plant groups were indicated by the black solid lines, and the pathway that pika suppress poisonous plants was indicated by red solid line. The sizes of the lines indicate the strengths of species interactions. Credits: Xiaona Zheng (photographs)."

    "text": "1.1 Statistical analyses\nAll data were analyzed using linear models, generalized linear mixed models, or generalized additive models, with the choice of model and statistical family guided by the structure and distribution of the data. Posthoc comparisons were conducted only when the pika × S. chamaejasme interaction term was significant. For the 2021 field surveys, we fit generalized linear mixed models with plot and month as random effects. We then used generalized additive mixed models for S. chamaejasme cover and active pika burrow density, with plot as a random effect, and linear regression models for dung density and S. chamaejasme cover. For the field manipulation experiments in 2022 and 2023, we constructed generalized linear mixed models with the dependent variables (e.g., grass bites per step, sedge bites, weight gain) regressed against the interactive effect of pika and S. chamaejasme treatments, while including block, year, and month as random effects to capture the hierarchical structure of the data. Models assumed gaussian, beta (for proportions), or tweedie (for non-normal data) distributions, selected based on data type and model fit. A significance threshold of P = 0.05 was applied, with TukeyHSD or Sidak posthoc tests used where appropriate. All data management, modeling, and visualization were carried out in R, with dependencies managed using renv. The main modeling packages were glmmTMB and mgcv, with DHARMa used for model diagnostics. Data management relied on the tidyverse suite of packages. A complete record of package versions is available in the renv.lock file in the repository: https://github.com/ddlawton/pika_yak_interactions."
