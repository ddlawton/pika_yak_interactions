    "text": "The following figure (Figure 1) shows pika feeding frequency (A) and yak grazing frequency (B) by each pika and poison plant treatment, with significance indicated by letters. It also shows the relationship between pika burrow density (C) and yak dung density (D) with S. chamaejasme cover. Overall, these results align with those seen in the original figure.\nPikas preferred forbs and S. chamaejasme over grasses and sedges, while yaks preferred grasses, then sedges, then forbs, and completely avoided S. chamaejasme. This pattern is further reinforced by plots C and D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: diet selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Pika feeding results\nThere was a significant effect of plant group on pika feeding (Table 1), with S. chamaejasme consumption being the highest, followed by forbs, then sedges and grasses (Table 2).\n\n\n2 Yak grazing results\nThere was a significant effect of plant group on yak grazing (Table 3), with grass consumption being the highest, followed by sedges, and then forbs (Table 4).\n\n\n3 Burrow and dung density\nI did not run specific statistical models for plots C and D.

    "text": "1.1 Statistical analyses\nAll data were analyzed using linear models, generalized linear mixed models, or generalized additive models, with the choice of model and statistical family guided by the structure and distribution of the data. Posthoc comparisons were conducted only when the pika × S. chamaejasme interaction term was significant. For the 2021 field surveys, we fit generalized linear mixed models with plot and month as random effects. We then used generalized additive mixed models for S. chamaejasme cover and active pika burrow density, with plot as a random effect, and linear regression models for dung density and S. chamaejasme cover. For the field manipulation experiments in 2022 and 2023, we constructed generalized linear mixed models with the dependent variables (e.g., grass bites per step, sedge total bites, weight gain) regressed against the interactive effect of pika and S. chamaejasme treatments, while including block, year, and month as random effects to capture the hierarchical structure of the data. Models assumed gaussian, beta (for proportions), or tweedie (for non-normal data) distributions, selected based on data type and model fit. A significance threshold of P = 0.05 was applied, with TukeyHSD or Sidak posthoc tests used where appropriate. All data management, modeling, and visualization were carried out in R, with dependencies managed using renv. The main modeling packages were glmmTMB and mgcv, with DHARMa used for model diagnostics. Data management relied on the tidyverse suite of packages. A complete record of package versions is available in the renv.lock file in the repository: https://github.com/ddlawton/pika_yak_interactions."

    "text": "Figure 1: Forage Quality metrics by treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 ADF model summary\nADF content was slightly but significantly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had no measurable effect (Table 1). A significant positive interaction indicated that pika partially offset the reduction in ADF caused by the poison plant. Contrasts showed that poison plant treatment generally lowered ADF, but this effect was weaker in pika-present plots (Table 2). Random variation across blocks and months was small, with no detectable year-to-year variation (Table 1).\n\n\n2 CP model summary\nCrude protein (CP) content was significantly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had a marginally non-significant positive effect (Table 3). A strong positive interaction showed that pika presence substantially mitigated the reduction in CP caused by the poison plant. Contrasts confirmed lower CP in treated plots without pika, but this reduction was much smaller in pika-present plots (Table 4). Random variation across blocks and months was minimal, with no variation across years.\n\n\n3 EE model summary\nEther extract (EE) content was slightly reduced by pika presence, while the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment alone had no significant effect (Table 5). A significant positive interaction indicated that pika mitigated the small negative effect of the poison plant on EE. Contrasts revealed only minor and inconsistent differences among treatment combinations, with most effects small in magnitude (Table 6). Random variation across months was minimal, with no variation across blocks or years.\n\n\n4 NDF model summary\nNeutral detergent fiber (NDF) content was slightly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had no significant effect (Table 7). The interaction between pika and the poison plant was not significant, indicating that pika did not modify the treatment’s effect on NDF. Random variation was minimal across blocks and absent across years and months.\n\n\n5 Tables\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Model summary for ADF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\ncomponent\ngroup\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\n(Intercept)\n-0.818\n0.025\n-32.358\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika\n0.009\n0.019\n0.458\n0.647\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npoison plant\n-0.062\n0.020\n-3.138\n0.002\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika : poison treamtent\n0.079\n0.028\n2.842\n0.004\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nblock\nblock\n0.029\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nyear\nyear\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nmonth\nmonth\n0.027\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Estimated marginal means contrasts for ADF by treatment group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrast\nodds.ratio\nSE\ndf\nnull\nz.ratio\np.value\n\n\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika No S. chamaejasme\n0.991\n0.019\nInf\n1\n-0.458\n0.968\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n1.064\n0.021\nInf\n1\n3.138\n0.009\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.974\n0.019\nInf\n1\n-1.328\n0.545\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n1.073\n0.021\nInf\n1\n3.596\n0.002\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.983\n0.019\nInf\n1\n-0.870\n0.820\n\n\nno pika S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.916\n0.018\nInf\n1\n-4.465\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Model summary for CP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\ncomponent\ngroup\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\n(Intercept)\n-2.386\n0.022\n-107.029\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika\n0.032\n0.017\n1.876\n0.061\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npoison plant\n-0.154\n0.018\n-8.721\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika : poison treamtent\n0.133\n0.024\n5.453\n0.000\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nblock\nblock\n0.012\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nyear\nyear\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nmonth\nmonth\n0.031\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Estimated marginal means contrasts for CP by treatment group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrast\nodds.ratio\nSE\ndf\nnull\nz.ratio\np.value\n\n\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika No S. chamaejasme\n0.969\n0.016\nInf\n1\n-1.876\n0.238\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n1.167\n0.021\nInf\n1\n8.721\n0.000\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.989\n0.017\nInf\n1\n-0.657\n0.913\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n1.204\n0.021\nInf\n1\n10.588\n0.000\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n1.021\n0.017\nInf\n1\n1.219\n0.614\n\n\nno pika S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.848\n0.015\nInf\n1\n-9.375\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Model summary for EE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\ncomponent\ngroup\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\n(Intercept)\n-3.440\n0.028\n-124.026\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika\n-0.048\n0.022\n-2.193\n0.028\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npoison plant\n-0.033\n0.022\n-1.499\n0.134\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika : poison treamtent\n0.090\n0.031\n2.902\n0.004\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nblock\nblock\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nyear\nyear\n0.011\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nmonth\nmonth\n0.038\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Estimated marginal means contrasts for EE by treatment group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrast\nodds.ratio\nSE\ndf\nnull\nz.ratio\np.value\n\n\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika No S. chamaejasme\n1.050\n0.023\nInf\n1\n2.193\n0.125\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n1.034\n0.023\nInf\n1\n1.499\n0.438\n\n\nno pika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.991\n0.022\nInf\n1\n-0.412\n0.976\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / no pika S. chamaejasme\n0.985\n0.022\nInf\n1\n-0.695\n0.899\n\n\npika No S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.944\n0.021\nInf\n1\n-2.605\n0.045\n\n\nno pika S. chamaejasme / pika S. chamaejasme\n0.959\n0.021\nInf\n1\n-1.910\n0.224\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Model summary for NDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect\ncomponent\ngroup\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\n(Intercept)\n0.510\n0.019\n27.440\n0.000\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika\n0.026\n0.025\n1.031\n0.303\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npoison plant\n-0.051\n0.025\n-2.030\n0.042\n\n\nfixed\ncond\nNA\npika : poison treamtent\n0.022\n0.035\n0.611\n0.541\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nblock\nblock\n0.011\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nyear\nyear\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nran_pars\ncond\nmonth\nmonth\n0.000\nNA\nNA\nNA"

    "text": "Figure 1: Plant cover between experimental plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Forbs Cover\nForb cover showed a small but significant reduction with the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, while pika presence alone had no measurable effect (Table 1). The interaction between pika and poison plant treatments was not significant, indicating that pika did not alter the poison plant’s effect on forb cover. Random variation across blocks and years was small, and no month-to-month variation was detected.\n\n\n2 Grasses Cover\nGrass cover was significantly reduced by the poison plant (S. chamaejasme) treatment, with odds of occurrence dropping to less than half in treated plots. Pika presence alone had no detectable effect in untreated plots, but in treated plots, pika presence substantially increased grass cover, offsetting some of the negative effect of the poison plant. This positive interaction suggests that pika may facilitate grass recovery when S. chamaejasme is present. Random variation across blocks and months was small, and no variation was detected across years. See the model summary and contrast tables (Table 3, Table 4).\n\n\n3 S. chamaejasme Cover\nStellera chamaejasme cover was strongly increased in the poison plant treatment (Table 5). Pika presence alone had no significant effect in untreated plots but significantly reduced the large cover gains from the poison plant treatment (Table 6). This interaction indicates that pika substantially suppress S. chamaejasme when it is present in high abundance.

The positive pika × poison plant interaction was marginally non-significant (p = 0.076), suggesting a possible tendency for pika to lessen the negative effect of the poison plant (Table 7).

    "text": "The following figure (Figure 1) shows the relationship between yak bite/step ratios per plant across he pika and poison plant treatments. We see decreased bite/step ratios for grasses and sedges within the no pika and poison plant treatment plots. Whereas all other treatment levels had a consistent bite/step ratio. Forbs is an exception where there is no difference except with increase forb bite/step ratio in the pika x poison plant treatment level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: diet selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model revealed that the presence of S. chamaejasme significantly reduced yak grass feeding efficiency (bite/step ratio) (Table 1), but this negative effect was mitigated when pikas were present, as shown by a significant positive interaction (Table 1). Pika presence alone did not influence feeding efficiency; however, in combination with S. chamaejasme, it substantially improved it (Table 2). These results suggest that pikas may facilitate yak foraging by offsetting the detrimental effects of poisonous plants.\n\n\n\nThe presence of S. chamaejasme significantly reduced yak feeding efficiency on sedges, as shown by a strong negative main effect in the model summary (Table 3). Although pika presence alone had no effect, the significant positive interaction indicates that pikas mitigated the negative impact of the poisonous plant. Specifically, sedge bite/step ratios were much lower when S. chamaejasme was present without pikas, but this reduction was substantially less when pikas were present (see pairwise contrasts in Table 4). These findings suggest that pikas facilitate yak foraging on sedges by reducing the negative effects of S. chamaejasme.\n\n\n\nFor forbs, neither pika presence nor S. chamaejasme alone significantly affected yak feeding efficiency, as both main effects were non-significant (see Table 5). However, there was a marginally non-significant interaction (p = 0.067), suggesting a possible moderating effect of pikas on the impact of the poisonous plant. In the pairwise contrasts, the bite/step ratio was significantly lower when S. chamaejasme was present and pikas were absent compared to when both were present (see Table 6). This indicates a weaker but still detectable facilitative effect of pikas on yak forb consumption in the presence of S. chamaejasme."

However, the strong positive interaction term (+0.132 kg/day) indicates that pika presence largely neutralizes the negative effect of S. chamaejasme, resulting in weight gain similar to control conditions.
