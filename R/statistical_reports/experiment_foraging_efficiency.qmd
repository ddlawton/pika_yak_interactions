The following figure (@fig-bite_step_figures) shows the relationship between yak bite/step ratios per plant across he pika and poison plant treatments. We see decreased bite/step ratios for grasses and sedges within the no pika and poison plant treatment plots. Whereas all other treatment levels had a consistent bite/step ratio. Forbs is an exception where there is no difference except with increase forb bite/step ratio in the pika x poison plant treatment level.

## Grass Bite Steps

The model revealed that the presence of *S. chamaejasme* significantly reduced yak grass feeding efficiency (bite/step ratio) (@tbl-grasses-bite-step-model-summary), but this negative effect was mitigated when pikas were present, as shown by a significant positive interaction (@tbl-grasses-bite-step-model-summary). Pika presence alone did not influence feeding efficiency; however, in combination with *S. chamaejasme*, it substantially improved it (@tbl-grasses-bite-step-model-contrasts). These results suggest that pikas may facilitate yak foraging by offsetting the detrimental effects of poisonous plants.

## Sedge Bite Steps

The presence of *S. chamaejasme* significantly reduced yak feeding efficiency on sedges, as shown by a strong negative main effect in the model summary (@tbl-sedges-bite-step-model-summary). Although pika presence alone had no effect, the significant positive interaction indicates that pikas mitigated the negative impact of the poisonous plant. Specifically, sedge bite/step ratios were much lower when *S. chamaejasme* was present without pikas, but this reduction was substantially less when pikas were present (see pairwise contrasts in @tbl-sedges-bite-step-model-contrasts). These findings suggest that pikas facilitate yak foraging on sedges by reducing the negative effects of *S. chamaejasme*.

## Forbs Bite Steps

For forbs, neither pika presence nor *S. chamaejasme* alone significantly affected yak feeding efficiency, as both main effects were non-significant (see @tbl-forbs-bite-step-model-summary). However, there was a marginally non-significant interaction (p = 0.067), suggesting a possible moderating effect of pikas on the impact of the poisonous plant. In the pairwise contrasts, the bite/step ratio was significantly lower when *S. chamaejasme* was present and pikas were absent compared to when both were present (see @tbl-forbs-bite-step-model-contrasts). This indicates a weaker but still detectable facilitative effect of pikas on yak forb consumption in the presence of *S. chamaejasme*.

## Grass Plant Bites

Yak grazing on grasses was significantly reduced by the presence of the poisonous plant *S. chamaejasme*, with a large negative estimate (-45.3) indicating fewer bites in treated plots. The pika treatment alone had no significant effect on grass bites. However, the interaction between pika presence and *S. chamaejasme* treatment was positive and significant (+43.9), suggesting that pika presence mitigates the negative effect of the poisonous plant on grass bites. Contrasts confirm that plots with *S. chamaejasme* had substantially lower grazing, except when pikas were present, which restored grazing levels.

## Forb Plant Bites

Yak bites on forbs were generally low and showed no significant differences across pika or poisonous plant treatments. The *S. chamaejasme* treatment showed a marginally positive effect on forb bites, but this was not statistically significant (p ~ 0.058). The interaction between pika and *S. chamaejasme* was also non-significant. Overall, yak grazing on forbs appears unaffected by either treatment or their interaction.

## Sedge Plant Bites

Grazing on sedges was significantly reduced by *S. chamaejasme* treatment (estimate = -0.42), indicating fewer yak bites in plots with the poisonous plant. Pika presence alone had no significant effect, but the pika Ã— *S. chamaejasme* interaction was strongly positive (+0.36), showing that pika presence offsets the reduction caused by the poisonous plant. Contrasts reveal that sedge grazing decreases with *S. chamaejasme* unless pikas are present, which helps maintain grazing levels.

## Total Plant Bites

Yak grazing overall was significantly reduced by *S. chamaejasme* treatment, with 131 fewer bites on average compared to control plots without the poisonous plant. Pika presence alone did not significantly influence total bites. However, the strong positive interaction term (+119.5) indicates that pika presence substantially offsets the negative effect of *S. chamaejasme*, restoring grazing rates close to control levels. Contrasts confirm that while *S. chamaejasme* sharply reduces total bites, this effect is largely absent when pikas are present.

## Total Step Model Summary

Yak movement (total steps) was significantly higher in *S. chamaejasme* plots, with an average increase of 113 steps compared to control plots without the poisonous plant (@tbl-total-step-model-summary). Pika presence alone did not significantly affect step counts. However, the strong negative interaction term (âˆ’136.1, @tbl-total-step-model-summary) indicates that when pikas were present, the *S. chamaejasme*-induced increase in movement was eliminated. Contrasts show that while *S. chamaejasme* alone led to more steps, this effect was absent or reversed in the presence of pikas, suggesting that pikas dampen the plantâ€™s impact on yak movement patterns (@tbl-total-step-model-contrasts).

## Weight Gain Summary

The poisonous plant *S. chamaejasme* substantially reduced yak weight gain, with a mean loss of 0.108 kg/day compared to control plots without the plant, while pika presence alone had no significant effect on weight gain (@tbl-weight-gain-model-summary). However, the strong positive interaction term (+0.132 kg/day) indicates that pika presence largely neutralizes the negative effect of *S. chamaejasme*, resulting in weight gain similar to control conditions. Contrasts show that while *S. chamaejasme* sharply reduces weight gain in the absence of pikas, this reduction disappears when pikas are present, suggesting a facilitative role of pikas in mitigating plant-induced losses (@tbl-weight-gain-model-contrasts).
