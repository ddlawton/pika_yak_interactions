# Figure 4 - Data Management, Modeling, and Visualization Script
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# Author: Douglas Lawton
# Date: July 27, 2025
# Purpose:
#   - To reproduce the full analytical and graphical workflow
#     for Figure 4 (panels a-f) of the study examining pika-plant
#     interactions on the Tibetan Plateau.
#   - Includes raw data visualization, GLMM fitting with model
#     selection, estimated marginal means analysis, and plot export.
# =============================================================

# modeling steps
# so for plots A-F, the same basic modeling structure should be used
# with differing response variables. Lets start with the most complex 
# we have the following variables:
# pika_treatment (two levels), posion_plant_treatment (two levels), block (4 levels),
# yak (2 yaks per treatment plot) and # month (three months)
# I think I will test these following structures, from most to least complex:

# response ~ pika_treatment * posion_plant_treatment + (1|block) + (1|block:yak:month) 
# response ~ pika_treatment * posion_plant_treatment + (1 | block) + (1 | month)
# response ~ pika_treatment * posion_plant_treatment + (1 | block)
# response ~ pika_treatment * posion_plant_treatment + (1 | month)
# response ~ pika_treatment * posion_plant_treatment 

# I have built functions to help reduce redunancy in this script
